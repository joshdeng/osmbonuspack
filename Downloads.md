Following the "extraordinary" plan of Google to <a href='http://google-opensource.blogspot.fr/2013/05/a-change-to-google-code-download-service.html'>stop the standard Downloads feature</a> of Google code, the project downloads are now hosted in the Source tab, in a dedicated project <a href='http://code.google.com/p/osmbonuspack/source/browse/#svn%2FBonusPackDownloads'>BonusPackDownloads</a>.

To download a file: in the list, click on the filename link. Then in the detailed page search for "File info" panel on the right, and click on the "View raw file" link.


This is the less bad option we found (after experiencing the Google Drive option, which was just irrelevant when using an Android device to download an application...).
Better ideas will be welcomed.
